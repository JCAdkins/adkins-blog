# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using pnpm
- Package added to dependencies in `package.json`
- Lock file (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) updated with new dependency tree

### 2. Root Layout Update (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the ThemeProvider closing tag
- Positioned to ensure analytics tracking across all pages while maintaining existing component structure

### 3. Implementation Details
- **Project Type**: Next.js App Router (using `app/` directory)
- **Location**: Root layout file (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- **Placement**: Inside `<body>` tag after all providers and children components
- **Import Source**: `@vercel/analytics/next` (Next.js-specific version)

## Verification

### Package Installation
✓ Package successfully installed and resolved
✓ Dependencies updated in package.json
✓ Lock file properly updated with pnpm

### Code Quality
✓ No new ESLint errors introduced (existing unused variable warnings are pre-existing)
✓ Analytics import and component usage are syntactically correct
✓ TypeScript types properly resolved for Analytics component

### Build Status
Note: The project has pre-existing build issues unrelated to this change:
- `/blogs` page timeout during static generation
- `/admin` route dynamic server usage
- API URL configuration issues

These issues existed before the Analytics implementation and are not caused by the changes made.

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
2. `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated with new dependency tree
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component

## Implementation Notes
- The Analytics component is placed at the end of the body tag to ensure it doesn't block rendering of main content
- The component will automatically track page views and web vitals when deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is needed; analytics will be enabled when the project is deployed to Vercel with analytics enabled in the project settings
- The implementation follows Vercel's official documentation for Next.js App Router projects
