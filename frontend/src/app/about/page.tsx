        Hi there — I’m a passionate photographer and visual storyteller with a
        deep love for capturing the world through my lens. This blog is my
        personal corner of the internet where I share not just photos, but the
        stories, moments, and insights behind them.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Whether it’s a sweeping landscape at golden hour, a candid street scene,
        or an up-close detail that might otherwise go unnoticed — my goal is
        always to connect people to the emotion and meaning behind each shot.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Alongside my photography, I also write about the creative process,
        travel adventures, gear I love, and lessons I’m learning as a creator. I
        believe great photography isn’t just about the technical side — it’s
        about presence, curiosity, and seeing beauty in the everyday.
      </p>
