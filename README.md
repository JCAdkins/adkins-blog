# <font size="5">**Photography Web Blog**</font>
This project is dedicated to creating a photography web blog that seamlessly integrates with the self-hosted photo app, Immich. The goal is to provide an efficient platform for storing and serving image data, while offering a unique blogging experience with seamless media management.

## **Why Immich?**
I decided to create this photo blogging app because I wanted a system that combines blogging with easy access to images stored in a self-hosted solution. By integrating Immich, I can ensure that photos used in blog posts are also available through the Immich app, enabling a smooth workflow between blog creation and media management.

## **Features**
Blog Posts: Write and share blog posts with integrated photo galleries.

### <u>Immich Integration:</u> 
Leverage Immich's API to store and manage images, enhancing the user experience with self-hosted image management.

### <u>Future Enhancements:</u> 
There are a lot of ideas planned for future features, including exploring the AI capabilities and facial recognition that Immich provides.

## **Progress and Updates**
I have decided to move from an MVC-style architecture to MVVM-style. This should allow me to more easily debug the application right now, but provide for easier testing when I eventually get around to that in the future.

## **Future Plans**
Experiment with Immich's AI and facial recognition features.

Enhance the blog with dynamic content and improved performance.

Continuously improve the user interface and experience.

Stay tuned for updates as this project evolves!
